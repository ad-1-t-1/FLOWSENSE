The model predicts flood probability, impact, and resilience in Mumbai based on:
Forecasted rainfall
Terrain vulnerability (elevation, slope, NDVI, urban cover, distance to water)
Human vulnerability (population density, shelter access, infrastructure)
Heuristic flood behavior (physics-inspired weighting)
The goal:
Instead of just saying “this area will flood,” it answers “how badly, how fast, and how ready are the people?”
